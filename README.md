# PyTorch Transformer Notes

Welcome to my repository where I document my journey of learning the PyTorch implementation of transformers. This repository contains comprehensive notes and code examples that explain different aspects of the transformer model.

## Repository Overview

This repository is designed for anyone who is starting out with transformers in deep learning, specifically using PyTorch. If you're new to transformers, I suggest starting from the **Model Block** section, as it will guide you through the key concepts and code implementation.

## What You Can Explore

- **Model Block**: A detailed breakdown of how the transformer model is structured in PyTorch.
- **Notes**: I have uploaded all my notes and key takeaways from my learning journey, covering essential concepts such as multi-head attention, positional encoding, self-attention, and more.
- **Code Examples**: You'll find code implementations with explanations, including the forward pass, attention layers, and how to work with transformers.

## How to Use

1. Start from the **Model Block** to understand the core architecture of transformers in PyTorch.
2. Dive deeper into the notes to grasp the theoretical concepts and how they are implemented in the code.
3. Explore and experiment with the code in this repository to enhance your understanding and learn by doing.
